This is my attempt to recreate the Google homepage. All links should be functional and take you to the actual locations they would on the original Google page. As far as the design, I did not attempt to make my page identical, rather I tweeked sizes, colors, images, etc. to make it appealling to me, appealing to my family, and supporting of Black America during a time it needed (and a time I had to leave my profession as a police officer due to racial discrimination  against myself and fellow black officers).

The searchbar and submit button are the only items non-functional on the page (I believe).

A page like this brings me joy and I cannot wait to continue to improve on my talents. I hope you enjoy! Feel free to use my code to help you learn.
